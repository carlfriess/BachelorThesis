\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Thank you to the Integrated Systems Laboratory\cite{iis} for enabling Swissloop to build both Escher and Mujinga by providing resources, help and know-how. In particular, thank you to Dr. Michele Magno for supervising this Bachelor Thesis and providing invaluable advice.

Furthermore, I would like to thank Swissloop as an association for providing the framework  for this Bachelor Thesis and as a team which has worked tirelessly over the past year to design and build a Hyperloop pod with unprecedented performance. I am very grateful to Hanno Kappen for designing the PCB which in combination with the Texas Instruments Launchpad provided the platform for this Thesis. Thank you also to Laurin Paech for developing the Control Panel which is closely tied to the software developed in this Thesis.
